I am highly pleased with Óscar's implication in the project.
He has contributated in all the steps of the assignment's creation.
It is notable that Óscar searched in the literature any useful information and knowledge;
he explained clearly his own ideas, sugested possible improvements and he was always willing to make changes.
Moreover, I want to highligth his willingness and participation in the group meetings in order to work in team.
Due to these reasons, my evaluation in this project for Óscar Piette is a 10.
